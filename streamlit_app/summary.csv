SEC 2389 ( 03-23)","INFORMATION FOR ENTITIES SUBJECT TO 
EXAMINATION OR INSPECTION BY  
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION  
  
The examination staff (staf f) of the Division  of Examinations ( EXAMS ) of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (Commission) has prepared this brochure to provide information 
about examinations it conduct s, including  information about the examination process and 
the methods the staff employ s for resolving issues identified d uring examinations. This 
information, provided to entities undergoing examination or inspection , should help entities 
to understand better the  staff’s objectives in this area.1 
 
I. PURPOSE OF EXAMINATIONS  
Commission representatives have statutory authority  to conduct , at any time or from time to 
time, reasonable periodic, special , and other examinations of the records of specified 
Commission -regulated entities  (entity  or entities ). The s taff carries out these responsibilities in  
11 regional offices and headquarters  in Washington, DC. EXAMS ’ mission  is to protect 
investors, ensure market integrity, and support responsible capital formation through risk-focused 
strategies that: improve compliance , prevent fraud , monitor risk , and inform policy. 
During exam inations, the staff will seek to determine whether the entity being examined is : 
conducting its activities in accordance with the federal securities laws and the rules adopted 
under these laws ( as well as , where applicable, the rules of self-regulatory organizations subject 
to the Commission ’s oversight); adhering to the disclosures it has made to  its clients, customers , 
the general public, and /or the Commission ; and implementing supervisory systems and/or 
compliance policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the entity ’s 
operations are in compliance with applicable legal requirements .  
The staff  appreciates each entity ’s cooperation as it will facilitate the staff ’s ability to time ly 
complete the examination . Entities should work promptly to  provide the staff  with complete and 
accurate information and ensure that knowledgeable employees are made available to  help the 
staff better understand the entity and its operations.  
II. THE EXAMINATION PROCESS  
The Commission ’s exam ination  program is risk -based . An entity may be selected for 
examination for any number of reasons including , but not limited to,  a statutory mandate that 
requires the Commission to examine the entity ; the entity ’s risk profile; a tip, complaint, or 
referral; or a review of a particular compliance risk area. The reason an entity has been selected 
                                                 
1  This statement represents the views of staff of EXAMS. It is not a rule, regulation, or statement of the 
Commission. The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content. This statement, like all staff 
statements, has no legal force or effect: it does not alter or amend applicable law, and it creates no new or additi onal 
obligations for any person.   
SEC 2389 ( 03-23) -2- for examination is non-public information and typically will not be shared with the entity under 
examination . As part of the pre -examination planning process, the staff  strives to efficiently  
allocate resources and minimize , if possible, any  overlap with the scope of any recent or ongoing 
examinations or investigations by other regulators or Commission staff  in other Commission 
offices or divisions. If an entity has any concerns with respect to overlapping examinations or investigations , the entity should contact the Commission staff  involved.  
Throughout the examination process, the staff  may consult and/or coordinate with other 
Commission staff, including supervisory examination staff and staff in other Commission offices and divisions, regarding any issues identified and  the interpretation  and application of the 
securities laws and rules adopted under these laws, and, as  applicable, self -regulatory 
organization rules. As a result, the staff may share information and documents received from the 
entity with other Commission staff to the extent the staff  deems necessary or appropriate. The 
Commission may also share information and documents with other regulators or authorities. Whether the Commission has shared information and documents received from an entity is a confidential matter. Th ese an d other possible uses of information and documents provided to the 
staff are described in the Commission ’s Form 1661, which is provided to entities at the outset of 
an examination and may  be accessed at www.sec.gov/files/sec1661.pdf
. The staff does not accept 
limitations on  these routine uses. Similarly, when an entity or its service provider requires 
acceptance of terms and conditions to access  websites, applications, or other systems that contain 
the entity’s books and records, any action taken by the staff purportedly agreeing to such terms and conditions, including clicking  an “accept” button, will not constitute an acceptance of the 
terms or conditions and will not bind the staff or the Commission in  contract.  
Examinations may be conducted on an announced or unannounced basis. When the examination is announced, the staff typically phones the entity’s Chief Compliance Officer  or regulatory 
personnel and follows up with a letter notifying the entity  of the examination and requesting  
information , including documents, that the staff  will review as part of the examination . These 
information requests  are generally transmitted through secure email. Information regarding data 
delivery and  the use of secure email and file transfer  are available at www.sec.gov/exams
. While 
the staff cannot comment on the specific safeguards that the Commission takes to protect non-public information, the protection of non-public information, including documents and information provided by entities during examinations, is of the utmost importance to EXAMS . 
When the examination is unannounced, the staff may provide the entity with a request for information, including documents, upon arrival and may conduct an initial interview. In most 
instances, the staff  will request that informatio n and documents be provided in electronic format  
via secure transmission by a specified date. For any  records that cannot be produced in electronic 
format , the entity  should promptly make such records available for examination  in another 
manner . The Commission  expects that in most circumstances  records should be available to staff 
within 24 hours; however, the staff typically provides a longer period of time to produce records. The staff  will grant requests for reasonable extensions of time, wh ere appropriate. In all cases, 
the timely production of the requested information and documents will facilitate  the staff ’s 
efficient completion  of the examination .  
The staff  will typically request meetings (in  person , by telephone, or by  videoconference) with 
entity employees to discuss the entity ’s operations and the information and documents provided. 
The entity should make knowledgeable employees or other knowledgeable persons available to participate in the meetings. These meetings help the staff  gain a better understanding of the 
entity ’s activities and compliance processes.  During on- site meetings, the staff may ask for a tour  
SEC 2389 ( 03-23) -3- of the entity’s offices to gain an overall understanding of the entity’s organization, flow of work, 
and control environment. For videoconferences, meeting participants are encouraged to use their cameras and to use screen -sharing functions when helpful. In some circumstances, the staff may 
make unannounced and unscheduled visits to the entity’ s offices.  When  scheduling meetings  
with the staff , the entity ’s cooperati on will facilitate the examination.  
As the staff  review s information and documents the entity has provided, the staff  may make 
supplemental requests for information and documents. Throughout the examination, the entity should communicate promptly to the staff  any questions or concerns regarding the documents 
and information that have been requested. Entities are encouraged to keep  the staff informed of 
any relevant changes that occur during the examination , including any actions the entity has 
taken or plans to take to address any issues discussed with the staff . Although some examinations 
may initially be conducted by telephone or video conference, the staff  may decide at any point 
during the exam ination  to conduct an on- site visit.  
The staff  may also request relevant information and documents held by third- party service 
providers or agents (including custodians) that, for example, perform work for, or in conjunction with, the entity , or whose activities may have a material effect  on the entity ’s operations. The 
staff may send such requests to the entity or directly to the third-party service provider or agent. 
In addition, the staff  often  contact s the entity ’s clients, customers, or other knowledgeable 
persons , as necessary, to gather and/or verify relevant information.  
Once interviews with entity personnel have been completed, or at any time it is deemed reasonable to do so, the staff  may conduct a preliminary exit conference with the entity to 
discuss the examination status, including any outstanding requests for information, and, if appropriate, to raise any issues identified up to that point during the examination. T he entity may 
be given an opportunity to discuss the issues that the staff has raised and provide additional relevant information. Communications from th e staff do not, and are not intended to, constitute 
legal advice.  
III. CO
MPLETING AN EXAMINATION 
After the staff has completed  its interviews and analyses , the staff typically conducts an exit 
conference with the entity to discuss any issues identified during the examination. The entity will typically be given an opportunity to discuss any of the issues that the staff has raised during the examination and provide additional relevant information, including any actions that the entity has taken or plans to take to address the issues raised. In connection with any form of exit conference, the staff may speak with the entity ’s senior management and/or its board of 
directors . 
Section 4E (b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the staff  to provide the entity 
being examined or inspected with written notification indicating either that the examination or inspection has concluded, has concluded without findings, or that the staff requests the entity undertake corrective action , within 180 days from the l ater of the complet ion of the on- site 
portion (if applicable) of the examination  or inspection or the recei pt of all records requested 
from the entity being examined  or inspected . For certain complex examinations, the examination 
deadline may be extended for an additional 180- day period  without notification to the entity . 
None of these outcomes forecloses the Commission from taking any action, including but not limited to an enforcement action, against the  entity.  Even if the staff ’s written notification  does  
SEC 2389 ( 03-23) -4- not address a particular activity , that does not mean that all of an entity’ s activities comply with 
the federal securities laws.   
Generally, the staff  will provide an entity with written notification of an examination ’s 
completion by sending a deficiency letter . In addition to sending the entity  a deficiency  letter, the 
staff may refer the issues to the Commission ’s Division of Enforcement, a self-regulatory 
organization, state regulatory agency, or othe rs, including criminal authorities , for possible 
action . The staff  may  sometimes  make a referral  to the Division of Enforcement without 
conducting an exit conference or sending a deficiency letter , usually in exigent circumstances. 
The entity  will be asked to respond in writing to any issues identified in a deficiency letter, 
including any steps that it has taken or intends to take to address the issues and to prevent their 
recurrence. The entity ’s response will generally be due within 30 days of the date of the 
deficiency  letter  and should address all of the issues identified in the deficiency letter.  An entity ’s 
submission of a timely and complete response to a deficiency  letter  will expedite the staff ’s 
completion of the examination .  
If the staff  has comments on an entity ’s response, the staff  generally will either provide them to 
the entity within 60 days of receipt of the entity’s response, or contact the entity within the  60-
day period to discuss when the staff  will be able to  provide comments . If the staff  has no further 
comments after receiving an entity ’s response to a deficiency  letter, the  examination will be 
closed. This does not mean, however, that the staff concurs with the entity’s response. The staff  
generally does not return records  produced during an examination. The staff conducts a limited 
number of follow-up reviews to determine whether entities have taken the corrective actions 
discussed in their responses.   
I V. Q UESTIONS, CONCERNS, AND VERIFICATION OF STAFF  IDENTITY  
Questions, comments, complaints, or concerns arising during or after an examination, can be 
raised with the staff  or with their supervisors in the respective regional office or headquarters . 
Most questions and issues can be resolved by discussing them with the staff . Comments, 
complaints, or concerns can also be communicated through the Examination Hotline  
(202.551.E XAM  or examhotline@sec.gov). The Examination Hotline  provides the option to 
speak with either an attorney in the Division of Examinations in Washington, DC, or  staff in the 
Commission ’s Office of Inspector General . The Office of Inspector General is an independent 
office within the Commission that audits Commission programs and investigates allegations of employee misconduct. Persons speaking with staff on the Examination Hotline  may identify 
themselves or request anonymity .  
For all examinations, staff will identify themselves  and will present their Commission credentials 
upon request. The identity of staff  can be confirmed  through the Examination Hotline . 
V. I
NFORMATION REGARDING THE COMMISSION ’S OFFICE OF THE  
WHISTLEBLOWER  
Congress authorized the Commission  to provide monetary awards to eligible whistleblowers  who 
voluntarily come forward with high-quality, original information that leads to a successful Commission enforcement action in which the Commission obtains monetary sanctions totaling more than $1,000,000. The range for awards is between 10% and 30% of the monetary sanctions collected  in the Commission action or in a related action upon which the award is based. A  
SEC 2389 ( 03-23) -5- “whistleblower ” is an individual who voluntarily provides original information in writing to the 
Commission  about a possible violation of the federal securities laws that has occurred, is 
ongoing, or is about to occur. To be eligible for an award based on any information provided by 
the whistleblower that relates to a possible violation of the federal securities laws, the 
whistleblower must comply with the procedures and the conditions described in Rule 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. One of those procedures, among others, specifies that a whistleblower must provide the information to the Commission on Form TCR or through the Commission ’s online TCR portal and sign the required declaration. One of the conditions, 
among others, is that the whistleblower’s submission must be voluntary. Information is provided “voluntarily ” if it is provided before a request, inquiry, or demand that relates to the subject 
matter of the submission is directed to the whistleblower or a representative (i) by the Commission; (ii)  in connection with an investigation, inspection, or examination by the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board, or any self-regulatory organization; or (iii) in connection with an investigation by the Congress, any other authority of the federal government, or a state Attorney General or securities regulatory authority . A whistleblower must be an individual, 
providing information alone or jointly with others. A company or other entity cannot be a whistleblower. A person is not required to be an employee of an entity to submit information 
about that entity.  
The Commission ’s Office of the Whistleblower administers the whistleblower program. 
Additional information about the program, including how to submit a tip under the program, is 
available at www.sec.gov/whistleb lower
. The Office of the Whistleblower may be reached at

securities.
Instructions to Item 5(a):
1. All that is required as to the nature of the underwriters' obligation is whether the underwriters are or
will be committed to take and to pay for all of the securities if any are taken, or whether it is merely an agency or the 
type of best eff  orts arrangement under which the underwriters are required to take and to pay for only such securi-
ties as they may sell to the public. Conditions precedent to the underwriters' taking the securities, including market outs, need not be described except in the case of an agency or best eff  orts arrangement.
2. It is not necessary to disclose each member of a selling group. Disclosure may be limited to those
underwriters who are in privity of contract with the issuer with respect to the off  ering.
(b) State briefl  y the discounts and commissions to be allowed or paid to dealers, including all cash, securities,
contracts or other consideration to be received by any dealer in connection with the sale of the securities.

selling eff  orts of brokers or dealers or otherwise than through underwriters.
(d) If any of the securities are to be off  ered for the account of securityholders, identify each selling securit-
yhold- er, state the amount owned by the securityholder prior to the off  ering, the amount off  ered for his or her
account and the amount to be owned aft  er the off  ering. Provide such disclosure in a tabular format. At the bot-
tom of the table, provide the total number of securities being off  ered for the account of all securityholders and
describe what percent of the pre-off  ering outstanding securities of such class the off  ering represents.
Instruction to Item 5(d):
 Th  e term “securityholder” in this paragraph refers to benefi  cial holders, not nominee holders or other such 
holders of record. If the selling securityholder is an entity, disclosure of the persons who have sole or shared voting or 
investment power must be included.
(e) Describe any arrangements for the return of funds to subscribers if all of the securities to be off  ered are
notsold. If there are no such arrangements, so state.(f) If there will be a material delay in the payment of the proceeds of the off  ering by the underwriter to thePage 14is- suer, the salient provisions in this regard and the eff  ects on the issuer must be stated.
(g) Describe any arrangement to (1) limit or restrict the sale of other securities of the same class as those
to be off  ered for the period of distribution, (2) stabilize the market for any of the securities to be off  ered, or (3)
with- hold commissions, or otherwise to hold each underwriter or dealer responsible for the distribution of itspartici- pation.

ary authority and include an estimate of the amount of securities so intended to be confi  rmed.

SEC’s Collection of Information 
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number. Filing of this Form is mandatory. Sections 3(b) and 3(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“1933 Act”) 
authorizes the Commission to exempt, subject to the terms and conditions prescribed, certain classes of securities from registration 
under the 1933 Act. Regulation E [17 CFR 230.601 to 230.610a], promulgated pursuant to Sections 3(b) and 3(c) of the 1933 Act 
and Section 38 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”), exempts securities of small business investment companies 
(“SBICs”) registered as investment companies u nder the 1940 Act and business development companies (“BDCs”) from registration 
under the 1933 Act provided certain conditions are met. Rule 604 [17 CFR 230.604] under the 1933 Act requires SBICs and BDCs, 
when making an offering of securities pursuant to Regulation E, to notify the Commission of the offering by filing Form 1-E [17 
CFR 239.200]. The Commission staff uses the information to monitor usage of and compliance with Regulation E. The information 
collected on Form 1-E is publicly available. Any member of the public may direct to the Commission any comments concerning the 
accuracy of the burden estimate of this Form and any suggestions for reducing the burden of the Form. This collection of information 
has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C. § 3507. 
The notification shall be signed in accordance with Rule 604 [Reg.§230.604]. At least one copy shall be signed manually by or on behalf of the issuer and each 
selling security holder. Any copies not manually signed shall bear typed or printed signatures.

products, pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Exchange Act, to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
“Commission”) with certain information regarding its operation.  If documents containing information satisfying the Commission’ s
information requirements have been filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, copies of such documents may befiled with the Commission.  Security Futures Product Exchanges are also required to update certain information filed on Form
1-N on a periodic basis.
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it display s
a currently valid control number.  Sections 3(a)(1), 5, 6(a), and 23(a) of the Exchange Act authorize the Commission to collect
information on this Form 1-N.  See 15 U.S.C. §§ 78c(a)(1), 78e, 78f(a), and 78w(a).
Form 1-N is designed to enable the Commission to determine whether a Security Futures Product Exchange is in compliance
with the Exchange Act.
It is estimated that an exchange will spend approximately 31 hours completing the initial application on Form 1-N pursuant to
Rule 6a-4.  It also is estimated that each Security Futures Product Exchange will spend approximately 15 hours to prepare each
amendment to Form 1-N pursuant to Rule 6a-4.
Any member of the public may direct to the Commission any comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and
any suggestions for reducing this burden.
It is mandatory that an exchange seeking to operate as a national securities exchange for the sole purpose of trading security
futures products file a Form 1-N with the Commission.  It is also mandatory that Security Futures Product Exchanges file
amendments to Form 1-N under Rule 6a-4.
No assurance of confidentiality is given by the Commission with respect to the responses made in Form 1-N.  The public has
access to the information contained in Form 1-N.
This collection of information has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the clearance
requirements of 44 U.S.C. § 3507.  The applicable Privacy Act system of records is SEC-2 and the routine uses of the records
are set forth at 40 FR 39255 (August 27, 1975) and 41 FR 5318 (February 5, 1976).

Item 3.  Financial Statements
The appropriate financial statements set forth below of the issuer , or the issuer and its predecessors or any busi -
nesses to which the issuer is a successor must be filed as part of the Form 1 SA.  
Unless the issuer is a Canadian company, financial statements must be prepared on a consolidated basis in

Canadian company, such financial statements must be prepared in accordance with either US GAAP or Interna-
tional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  
If the financial statements comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB, such compliance must be explicitly and 
unreservedly stated in the notes to the financial statements.
The financial statements included pursuant to this item may be condensed, unaudited, and are not required to 
be reviewed. For additional guidance on presentation of the financial statements, issuers that report under U.S. 
GAAP should refer to Rule 8-03(a) of Regulation S-X. The financial statements for all issuers must include the

the reference in Rule 3-10(a) of Regulation S-X to “an issuer or guarantor of a guaranteed security that is 
registered or being registered is required to file financial statements required by Regulation S-X with respect to 
the guarantee or guaranteed security” instead refers to “an issuer or guarantor of a guaranteed security that is 
qualified or being qualified pursuant to Regulation A is required to file financial statements required by Item 3 
of Form 1-SA with respect to the guarantee or guaranteed security.” The definition of “parent company” is the 
same as in Rule 3-10(b)(1) of Regulation S-X, except that Rule 3-10(b)(1)(ii) instead reads as follows: “Is, or as 
a result of the subject offering statement will be, required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to Rule 
257(b) of Regulation A (§§ 230.251-230.263), or is an Exchange Act reporting company.” The parent company 
must also provide the disclosures required by Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X. The parent company may elect to 
provide these disclosures in a footnote to its consolidated financial statements or alternatively , in management’s 
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations described in Item 1 of Form 1-SA.

er’s affiliates whose securities collateralize any class of securities being offered must be provided as required by 
Rule 13-02 of Regulation S-X. The issuer may elect to provide these disclosures in a footnote to its consolidated 
financial statements or alternatively, in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results 
of operations described in Item 1 of Form 1-SA.
(f) Financial Statements of Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities.  Financial statements of a subsid -
iary that issues securities guaranteed by the parent or guarantees securities issued by the parent must be present -
ed as required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, except that the periods presented are those required by this item 
and the financial statements need not be audited.

mittee, or authorized officer or officers, discussed with the issuer ’s independent accountant the matters disclosed 
in the filing pursuant to this paragraph (a).

(1) the date on which the issuer was so advised or notified; 
(2) identification of the financial statements that should no longer be relied upon; (3) a brief description of the information provided by the accountant; and (4) a statement of whether the audit committee, or the board of directors in the absence of an audit com -

  c.  There is prominently set forth, on the cover page of the Form 10-Q, a statement that the registrant meets the conditions set 
forth in General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-Q and is therefore ﬁ ling this form with the reduced disclosure format.

Form 13F 
INFORMATION REQUIRED OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS 
PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(f) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT  OF 1934  
AND RULES THEREUNDER 
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
1. Rule as to Use of Form 13F. Institutional investment managers (“Managers”) must use 
Form 13F for reports to the Commission required by Section 13(f) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78m(f)] (“Exchange  Act”)  and rule 13f-1  [17 CFR 
240.13 f-1] thereunder. Rule 13f-1(a) provides that every Manager which exercises 
investment discretion with respect to accounts holding Section 13(f) securities, as defined in 
rule 13f-1(c), having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day of any month of 
any calendar year of at least $100,000,000 shall file a report  on Form 13F with the 
Commission within 45 days after the last day of such calendar year and within 45 days 
after the last day of each of the first three calendar quarters of the subsequent calendar year. 
2. Rules  to Prevent Duplicative Reporting. If two or more Managers, each of which is required  
by rule 13f-1  to file a report on Form 13F for the reporting period, exercise investment 
discretion with respect to the same securities, only one such Manager must include 
information regarding such securities in its reports on Form 13F. 
A Mana
ger having securities over which it exercises investment discretion that are reported 
by another Manager (or Managers) must identify the Manager(s) reporting on its behalf in 
the manner described in Special Instruction 5 . 
A Manager reporting holdings subject to shared investment discretion must identify the 
other Manager(s) with respect to which the filing is made in the manner described in 
Special Instruction 7. 
3. Filing of Form 13F. Rule 13f-1(a)(1) provides that a Manager must file a Form 13F report 
with the Commission within 45 days after the end of the calendar year and each of the first 
three calendar quarters of the subsequent calendar year. Form 13F must be filed 
electronically on the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval 
(“EDGAR”) system, unless a hardship exemption has been granted.  As required by Section 
13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured 
in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate 
regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission 
pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers can satisfy their 
obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending a copy either electronically 
(provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes) or in paper. 
SEC 1685 ( 07-23) Persons who respond to the collection of information contained in this form are not 
required to respond unless the form displays a currently valid OMB control number. 2 4. Official List of Section 13(f) Securities. The official list of Section 13(f) securities 
published by the Commission (“13F List”) lists the securities the holdings of which a 
Manager is to report on Form 13F. See rule 13f-1(c) [17 CFR 240.13f-1(c)]. Form 13F 
filers may rely on  the current 13F List in determining whether they need to report any 
particular securities holding. The current 13F List is available on  
www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13flists.htm. The 13F List is updated quarterly. 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTS 
Pursuant to Section 13(f)(4) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(4)], the Commission 
(1) may prevent or delay public disclosure of information reported on this form in accordance with 
Section 552 of Title 5 of the United States Code, the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552], 
and (2) shall not disclose information reported on this form identifying securities held by the 
account of a natural person or an estate or trust (other than a business trust or investment company). 
A Manager must submit in accordance with the procedures for requesting confidential treatment 
any portion of a report which contains information identifying securities held by the account of a 
natural person or an estate or trust (other than a business trust or investment company). 
A Manager should make requests for confidential treatment of information reported on this 
form in accordance with rule 24b-2(i) under the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.24b-2]. Requests 
relating to the non-disclosure of information identifying the securities held by the account of a 
natural person or an estate or trust (other than a business trust or investment company) must so 
state but need not, include an analysis of any applicable exemptions from disclosure under the 
Freedom of Information Act [17 CFR 200.80 ]. 
Paragraph (i) of rule 24b-2 requires a Manager filing confidential information with the 
Commission to indicate at the appropriate place in the public filing that the confidential portion 
has been so omitted and filed separately with the Commission. A Manager must comply with this 
provision by including on the Summary Page, after the Report Summary and prior to the List of 
Other Included Managers, a statement that confidential information has been omitted from the 
public Form 13F report and filed separately with the Commission. 
A Manager must file electronically, in accordance with rule 101(d) of Regulation S-T [17 
CFR 232.101(d)], all requests for and information subject to the request for confidential treatment 
filed pursuant to Section 13(f)(4) of the Exchange Act.  
A Manager requesting confidential treatment must provide enough factual support for its 
request to enable the Commission to make an informed judgment as to the merits of the request. 
The request must address all pertinent factors, including all of the following that are relevant 
1. If confidential treatment is requested as to more than one holding of securities, discuss each 
holding separately unless the Manager can identify a class or classes of holdings as to 
which the nature of the factual circumstances and the legal analysis are substantially the 
same. 3 2. If a request for confidential treatment is based upon a claim that the subject information is 
confidential, commercial or financial information, provide the information required by 
paragraphs 2.a through 2.e of this Instruction except that, if the subject information 
concerns security holdings that represent open risk arbitrage positions and no previous 
requests for confidential treatment of those holdings have been made, the Manager need 
provide only the information required in paragraph 2.f. 
a. Describe the investment strategy being followed with respect to the relevant securities 
holdings, including the extent of any program of acquisition and disposition (note that 
the term “investment strategy,” as used in this instruction, also includes activities such 
as block positioning). 
b. Explain why public disclosure of the securities would, in fact, be likely to reveal the 
investment strategy; consider this matter in light of the specific reporting requirements 
of Form 13F ( e.g., securities holdings are reported only quarterly and may be 
aggregated in many cases). 
c. Demonstrate that such revelation of an investment strategy would  be premature; 
indicate whether the Manager was engaged in a program of acquisition or disposition of 
the security both at the end  of the quarter and at the time of the filing; and address 
whether the existence of such a program may otherwise be known to the public. 
d. Demonstrate whether the information is customarily and actually kept private by the 
Manager and  that failure to grant the request for confidential treatment would be likely 
to cause harm to the Manager; show what use competitors could make of the 
information and how harm to the Manager could ensue. 
e. State, and provide justification for, the period of time for which confidential treatment 
of the securities holdings is requested. The time period specified may not exceed one 
(1) year from the date that the Manager is required to file the Form 13F report with the 
Commission. 
f. For securities  holdings that  represent open  risk arbitrage positions, the request must 
include good faith representations that:  
i. the securities holding represents a risk arbitrage position open on the last day of the 
period for which the Form 13F report is filed; and 
ii. the reporting Manager has a reasonable belief as of the period end that it may not 
close the entire position on or before the date that the Manager is required to file 
the Form 13F report with the Commission. 
If the Manager makes these representations in writing at the time that the Form 13F 
is filed, the Commission will automatically accord the subject securities holdings 
confidential treatment for a period of up to one (1) year from the date that the 
Manager is required to file the Form 13F report with the Commission. 4 g. At the expiration of the period for which confidential treatment has been g ranted 
pursuant to paragraph 2.e or 2.f of this Instruction (“Expiration Date”) and unless  a de 
novo  request for confidential treatment of the information that meets the requirements 
of paragraphs 2.a through 2.e of this Instruction is filed with the Commission at least 
fourteen  (14) days in advance of the Expiration Date, the Manager will make such 
security holding(s) public as set forth in Confidential Treatment Instruction 4. 
3. If the Commission grants a request for confidential treatment, it may delete details which 
would  identify the Manager and use the information in tabulations required by Section 
13(f)(4) absent a separate showing that such use of information could be harmful. 
4. Unless a hardship exemption is available, the Manager must submit electronically 
within 6 business days of the expiration of confidential treatment or notification of 
denial, as applicable, a Form 13F amendment to its previously filed public Form 13F 
report(s) for the calendar quarter to list and publicly disclose the holding(s) as to which 
the Commission denied confidential treatment or for which confidential treatment has 
expired. Such Form 13F amendment must be timely filed: (i) upon the denial by the 
Commission of a request for confidential treatment; (ii), upon expiration of the time 
period for which a Manager has requested confidential treatment; or (iii) upon the 
expiration of the confidential treatment previously granted for a filing. If a Manager 
files an amendment, the amendment must not be a restatement; the Manager must 
designate it as an amendment which adds new holdings entries. The Manager must 
include at the top of the Form 13F Cover Page the following legend to correctly 
designate the type of filing being made: 
THIS FILING LISTS SECURITIES HOLDINGS REPORTED ON THE FORM 13F 
FILED ON (DATE) PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL 
TREATMENT AND  FOR WHICH (THAT REQUEST WAS DENIED/CONFIDENTIAL 
TREATMENT EXPIRED) ON (DATE). 
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS 
1. This form consists of three parts: the Form 13F Cover Page (“Cover  Page”),  the Form 
13F Summary Page (“Summary Page”), and the Form 13F Information  Table 
(“Information  Table”).  
The Cover Page: 
2. The period end date used in the report is the last day of the calendar year or quarter, as 
appropriate, even though that  date may not be the same as the date used for valuation in 
accordance with Special Instruction 8. 
3. Amendments to a Form 13F report  must either restate the Form 13F report  in its entirety or 
include only holdings entries that are being reported in addition to those already reported 
in a current public Form 13F report for the same period. If the Manager is filing the Form 
13F report as an amendment, then, the Manager must check  the amendment box on the 5 Cover Page; enter the amendment number; and check the appropriate box to indicate 
whether the amendment (a) is a restatement or (b) adds new holdings entries. Each 
amendment must include a complete Cover Page and, if applicable, a Summary Page and 
Information Table. See rule 13f-1(a)(2) [17 CFR 240.13f-1(a)(2)]. 
4. Present the Cover Page and the Summary Page information in the format and  order provided 
in the form. If the Manager has a number assigned by the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority’s Central Registration Dep ository system or by the Investment Adviser 
Registration Depository system (“CRD number”), provide the Manager’s CRD number. If 
the Manager has a file number ( e.g., 801-, 8-, 866-, 802-) assigned by the Commission 
(“SEC file number”), provide the Manager’s  SEC file number. The Cover Page may 
include information in addition to the required information, so long as the additional 
information does not, either by its nature, quantity, or manner of presentation, impede the 
understanding or presentation of the required information. Place all additional information 
after the signature of the person signing the report (immediately preceding the Report Type 
section). Do not include any additional information on the Summary Page or in the 
Information Table. 
5. Designate the Report Type for the Form 13F report by checking the appropriate box in the 
Report Type section of the Cover Page, and include, where applicable, the List of Other 
Managers Reporting for this Manager (on the Cover Page), the Summary Page and the 
Information Table, as follows: 
a. If all of the securities with respect to which a Manager has investment  discretion are 
reported by  another Manager (or Managers), check the box for Report Type “13F  
NOTICE,”  include (on the Cover Page) the List of Other Managers Reporting for this 
Manager, and omit both the Summary Page and the Information Table. 
b. If all of the securities with respect to which  a Manager has investment discretion are 
reported in this report, check the box for Report Type “13F  HOLDINGS REPORT,”  
omit from the Cover Page the List of Other Managers Reporting for this Manager, and 
include both the Summary Page and the Information Table. 
c. If only part of the securities with respect to which a Manager has investment discretion is 
reported  by another Manager (or Managers), check the box  for Report Type “13F  
COMBINATION REPORT,”  include (on the Cover Page) the List of Other Managers 
Reporting for this Manager, and include both the Summary Page and the Information 
Table. 
Summary Page: 
6. Include the Report Summary, containing the Number of Other Included Managers, the 
Information Table Entry Total and the Information Table Value Total. 6 a. Enter as the Number of Other Included Managers the total number of other Managers 
listed in the List of Other Included Managers, not counting the Manager filing this 
report. See Special Instruction 7. If none, enter the number zero (“0”).  
b. Enter as the Information Table Entry Total the total number of line entries providing 
holdings information included in the Information Table. 
c. Enter as the Information Table Value Total the aggregate fair market value of all 
holdings reported in this report, i.e., the total for Column 4 (Fair Market Value) of all 
line entries in the Information Table. The Manager must express this total as a rounded 
figure,  corresponding to the individual Column 4 entries in the Information Table. See 
Special Instruction 8. 
d. Check the box on the Summary Page of the public Form 13F report if confidential 
treatment is being requested for some or all of the Manager’s holdings for this quarter -
end period. 
7. Include the List of Other Included Managers. Use the title, column headings and format 
provided. 
a. If this Form 13F report does not report the holdings of any Manager other than the 
Manager filing this report,  enter the word “NONE” under the title and omit the column 
headings and list entries. 
b. If this Form 13F report reports the holdings of one or more Managers other than the 
Manager filing this report, enter in the List of Other Included Managers all such 
Managers together with any CRD Number or SEC file number assigned to each 
Manager and, if known, the Managers’ respective Form 13F file numbers (The Form 
13F file numbers are assigned to Managers when they file their first Form 13F). Assign 
a number to each Manager in the List of Other Included Managers, and present the list 
in sequential order. The numbers need not be consecutive. The List of Other Managers 
must include all other Managers identified in Column 7 of the Information Table. Do 
not include the Manager filing this report. 
Information Table: 
8. In determining  fair market value, use the value at the close of trading on  the last trading day 
of the calendar year or quarter, as appropriate. Enter values rounded to the nearest dollar. 
9. A Manager may omit holdings otherwise reportable if the Manager holds, on the period end 
date, fewer than 10,000 shares (or less than $200,000 principal  amount in the case of 
convertible debt securities) and  less than $200,000 aggregate fair market value (and option 
holdings to purchase only such amounts). 
10. A Manager must report holdings of options only if the options themselves are Section 
13(f) securities. For purposes of the $100,000,000 reporting threshold, the Manager should 
consider only the value of such options, not the value of the underlying shares. The 7 Manager must give the entries in Columns 1 through 5 and  in Columns 7 and  8 of the 
Information Table, however, in terms of the securities underlying the options, not the 
options themselves. The Manager must answer Column 6 in terms of the discretion to 
exercise the option. The Manager must make a separate segregation in respect of securities 
underlying options for entries for each of the columns, coupled with a designation “PUT”  
or “CALL”  following such segregated entries in Column 5, referring to securities subject 
respectively to put and call options. A Manager is not required to provide an entry in 
Column 8 for securities subject to reported call options. 
11. Furnish the Information Table using the table title, column headings and format provided. 
Provide column headings once at the beginning of the Information Table; repetition of 
column headings on subsequent pages is not required. Present the table in accordance with 
the column instructions provided  in Special Instructions 11.b.i through 1 1.b.viii. Do not 
include any additional information in the Information Table. Begin the Information Table 
on a new page; do not include any  portion of the Information Table on either the Cover 
Page or the Summary Page. 
a. When  entering  information in Columns 4 through 8  of the Information Table, list 
securities of the same issuer and class with respect to which the Manager exercises sole 
investment discretion separately from those with respect to which investment discretion 
is shared.  Special Instruction 11.b.vi for Column 6  describes in detail how to report 
shared investment discretion. 
b. Instructions for each column in the Information Table: 
i. Column 1. Name of Issuer. Enter in Column 1 the name of the issuer for each class 
of security reported as it appears  in the current 13F List published by the 
Commission in accordance with rule 13f-1(c). Reasonable abbreviations are 
permitted. 
ii. Column 2.  Title of Class. Enter in Column 2  the title of the class  of the security 
reported as  it appears in the 13F List. Reasonable abbreviations are permitted. 
iii. Column 3. CUSIP Number and, Share Class level Financial Instrument Global 
Identifier (FIGI). Enter in Column 3 the nine (9) digit CUSIP number. A Manager 
also may optionally enter the twelve (12) character alphanumeric FIGI of the 
security in Column 3.  
iv. Column 4. Market Value. Enter in Column 4  the market value of the holding of the 
particular class of security as prescribed by Special Instruction 8. 
v. Column 5.  Amount and Type of Security. Enter in Column 5 the total number of 
shares of the class of security or the principal amount of such class. Use the 
abbreviation “SH” to designate shares and “PRN” to designate principal  amount. If 
the holdings being reported are put or call options, enter the designation “Put” or 
“Call,” as appropriate  8 vi. Column 6. Investment Discretion.  Segregate the holdings of securities of a class  
according to the nature of the investment discretion held by the Manager. 
Designate investment discretion as “sole”  (SOLE); “shared -defined”  (DEFINED); 
or “shared -other”  (OTHER), as described below: 
(A) Sole.  Designate as “sole”  securities over which the Manager exercised sole 
investment discretion. Report “sole” securities on one line. Enter the word 
“SOLE” in Column 6. 
(B) Shared-Defined.  If investment discretion is shared  with controlling and 
controlled companies (such  as bank  holding companies  and their  subsidiaries); 
investment advisers and investment companies advised by those advisers; or 
insurance companies and their separate accounts, then designate investment 
discretion as “shared -defined”  (DEFINED). 
For each holding of DEFINED securities, segregate the securities into two 
categories: those securities over which investment discretion is shared with 
another Manager or Managers on whose behalf this Form 13F report is being 
filed, and those securities over which investment discretion is shared with any 
other person, other than a Manager on whose behalf this Form 13F report is 
being filed. 
Enter each of the two segregations of DEFINED securities holdings on a 
separate line, and  enter the designation “DFND” in Column 6. See Special 
Instruction vii for Column 7. 
(C) Shared-Other.  Designate as “shared -other”  securities (OTHER) those over 
which  investment discretion is shared in a manner other than that described in 
Special Instruction (B) above. 
For each holding of OTHER securities, segregate  the securities into two 
categories: those securities over which investment discretion is shared with 
another Manager or Managers on whose behalf this Form 13F report is being 
filed,  and those securities  over which investment discretion is shared with any 
other person, other than a Manager on whose behalf this Form 13F report is 
being filed. 
Enter each segregation of OTHER securities holdings on a separate line, and 
enter the designation “OTR” in Column 6. See Special Instruction vii for 
Column 7. 
NOTE:  A Manager is deemed to share discretion with respect to all accounts 
over which any person under its control exercises discretion. A Manager of an 
institutional account, such as a pension fund or investment company, is not 
deemed to share discretion with the institution unless  the institution actually 
participated in the investment decision-making. 9 vii. Column 7. Other Managers. Identify each other Manager on whose behalf this 
Form 13F report is being filed  with whom investment discretion  is shared as to any 
reported holding by entering in this column the number assigned to the Manager 
in the List of Other Included Managers. 
Enter this number in Column 7 opposite the segregated entries in Columns 4, 5, and  8 
(and the relevant indication of shared discretion set forth in Column 6) as required 
by the preceding special  instruction. Enter no  other names or numbers in Column 
7. 
A Manager must report the conditions of sharing discretion with other Managers 
consistently for all holdings reported on a single line. 
viii. Column 8.  Voting Authority. Enter the number of shares for which the Manager 
exercises sole, shared, or no voting authority (none) in this column, as appropriate. 
The Commission deems a Manager exercising sole voting authority over specified 
“routine”  matters, and no authority to vote in “non -routine”  matters, for purposes 
of this Form 13F report to have no voting authority. “Non -routine”  matters include 
a contested election of directors, a merger, a sale of substantially all the assets, a 
change in the articles  of incorporation affecting the rights of shareholders, and a 
change in fundamental investment policy; “routine”  matters include selection of an 
accountant,  uncontested election of directors, and approval of an annual report. 
If voting authority is shared only in a manner similar to a sharing of investment 
discretion which would call for a response of “shared -defined”  (DEFINED) under 
Column 6, a Manager should report voting authority as sole under subdivision (a) 
of Column 8,  even though the Manager may be deemed to share investment 
discretion with that person under Special Instruction 11 .b.vi.

SEC 2858 (11-11)INSTRUCTIONS FOR FORM 13H 
 
Submission of the Form.  All submissions on Form 13H must be filed electronically through the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system.  For more information on filing through EDGAR, including instructions on how to obtain access to and file electronically through EDGAR, see the EDGAR Filer Manual (available on the Commission’s website at: http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar.shtml
).  
 Definitions.  The term “Securities Affiliate
” means an affiliate of the large trader that exercises 
investment discretion over NMS securities.  The term “affiliate
” means any person that directly or indirectly controls, is under common 
control with, or is controlled by the large trader.  The term “bank
” means a national bank, state member bank of the Federal Reserve System, state 
non-member bank, savings bank or association, credit union, or foreign bank.  The term “executive officer
” means “policy-making officer” and otherwise is interpreted in 
accordance with Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act. 
 Type of Filing.   Indicate the type of Form 13H filing by checking the appropriate box at the top 
of the cover page to Form 13H.  All filings must include a valid digital signature.  
SEC 2858 (11-11)If the filing is an “Initial Filing,” indicate whether it is a voluntary filing.  Voluntary filings are 
submitted regardless of whether the aggregate number of transactions effected reached the identifying activity level.  For voluntary filings, the large trader must input the date on which it submits its voluntary filing.  For non-voluntary filings, the large trader must input the first date 
on which the aggregate number of transactions effected reached the identifying activity level.  A non-voluntary “Initial Filing” must be submitted promptly after first effecting an aggregate number of transactions equal to or greater than the identifying activity level.  If the filing is an “Annual Filing,” input the applicable calendar year.    An “Amended Filing” must be filed promptly following the end of the calendar quarter in which any of the information contained in a Form 13H filing becomes inaccurate for any reason.  A large trader must file an “Amended Filing” when, for example, it changes its name, business address, organization type (e.g.
, the large trader partnership reincorporates as a limited liability 
company), or regulatory status (e.g. , a hedge fund registers under the Investment Company Act), 
or when its organizational chart changes in a manner relevant under Item 4(a) (e.g. , it adds or 
removes a Securities Affiliate).  If the filing is for “Inactive Status,” input the date that the large trader qualified for Inactive Status.  A large trader that has not effected aggregate transactions at any time during the previous full calendar year in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than the identifying activity level may file for Inactive Status.  A large trader shall become inactive, and exempt from the filing 
SEC 2858 (11-11)and self-identification requirements upon filing for Inactive Status until the identifying activity 
level is reached again. 
 If the filing is for “Reactivated Status,” indicate the date that the aggregate number of transactions again reached or exceeded the identifying activity level.  A filing for “Reactivated Status” must be submitted promptly after effecting an aggregate number of transactions --subsequent to filing for “Inactive Status” -- equal to or greater than the identifying activity level.  
In addition, a person may voluntarily elect to file for Reactivated Status prior to effecting aggregate transactions that are equal to or greater than the identifying activity threshold.  For such voluntarily filings for “Reactivated Status,” the date of the voluntarily filing should be entered rather than the date that the aggregate number of transactions again reached or exceeded 
the identifying activity level.  If the filing is a “Termination Filing,” indicate the date on which the large trader ceased operation.  For example, when one large trader merges into another large trader, resulting in only 
one surviving entity, the non-surviving large trader should specify the effective date of the merger in its Termination Filing.    The Form also requires that a large trader input its Taxpayer Identification Number.  The Form further requires a large trader to input its business and mailing addresses.  If those addresses are the same, for the mailing address field, the large trader may either input its address again or input “same.”  
SEC 2858 (11-11)The Form must be filed by a natural person who is authorized to submit it on behalf of the large 
trader.  The Commission may require the large trader to provide descriptive or clarifying information about the information disclosed in the Form 13H, and will contact the Authorized Person to provide such information.  To amend the name, phone number, and email address of the large trader, the large trader must modify its EDGAR profile.  Thereafter, changes will automatically be reflected in the Form 13H.  Item 1.  Businesses of the Large Trader.  Item 1 of the Form requires the large trader to specify, from among the enumerated choices, the types of business engaged in by the large trader, by checking as many as are applicable.  Select “Other” to indicate a financial entity not included in any of the enumerated categories and enter a short description for each such entity.  In addition, select “Other” if the large trader is an individual and input his or her occupation.  A large trader also is required, for itself and each of its Securities Affiliates, to describe the nature of its operations, including a general description of its trading strategies.  As an example, the following would be an appropriate description:  “Registered market-maker on [SRO], authorized participant for a number of ETFs based on foreign indices, and proprietary trading focusing on statistical arbitrage.”  Item 2.  Securities and Exchange Commission Filings.  The large trader must indicate whether it or any of its Securities Affiliates files forms with the Commission.  If it checks “Yes,” the large 
SEC 2858 (11-11)trader must input the names of the filing entities and, for each of them, input the form(s) they file 
and the applicable CIK number.  Item 3.  CFTC Registration and Foreign Regulators.     Item 3(a) requires the large trader to indicate whether it or any of its affiliates is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in any capacity, including as a “registered trader” pursuant to Sections 4i and 9 of the Commodity Exchange Act.  If it checks “Yes,” the large trader must input the name of each such entity and the registration number for each such entity. 
 Item 3(b) requires the large trader to indicate whether it or any of its Securities Affiliates is regulated by a foreign regulator.  Unlike Item 3(a), Item 3(b) applies only to the large trader and its Securities Affiliates.  If it checks “Yes,” the large trader must input the name of each such regulated entity and its primary foreign regulator.    Item 4.  Organization Information. To comply with Item 4(a), the large trader must attach an organizational chart that depicts the organization of the large trader.  At a minimum, the chart must include the large trader, its parent company (if applicable), all Securities Affiliates, and all entities identified in Item 3(a) of the Form (if any) (collectively, “Item 4 Affiliates”).  Item 4(b) requires that a large trader provide information about the Item 4 Affiliates.  Specifically, the large trader must input the names of Item 4 Affiliates and, for each one of them, 
SEC 2858 (11-11)also input the following information:  MPID(s); a brief description of its business, and its 
relationship to the large trader.  Item 4(c) requires that a large trader identify all affiliates that file a separate Form 13H.  Those affiliates will have a different LTID.  Item 4(d) permits a large trader to assign LTID suffixes to one or more of its Securities Affiliates.  A suffix should have no more than three characters, all of which must be numbers; no letters or special characters may be used.  The same suffix may not be assigned to more than one 
affiliate using the same LTID.  Item 5.  Governance of the Large Trader.   Item 5 captures basic information about the large trader organization.  All terms have the 
meanings generally ascribed to them in the United States.  If a foreign organization type has no comparable corporate form, check “Other” and input the organization type.  A large trader who is a natural person must check “Individual.”  Item 6.  List of Broker-Dealers at Which the Large Trader or Its Securities Affiliates Has an 
Account. Item 6 requires that a large trader identify each broker-dealer at which the large trader and any 
Securities Affiliate has an account.  Additionally, for each such broker-dealer, the large trader must indicate the type(s) of services provided.  The large trader must check as many of the following that apply:  Prime Broker; Executing Broker; Clearing Broker. 
SEC 2858 (11-11)Paperwork Reduction Act Disclosures . This collection of information has been reviewed by 
OMB in accordance with the clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C. 3507.  An agency may not 
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information un -
less it displays a currently valid control number. 
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorizes the SEC to collect the information on Form 
13H from large traders.  See 15 U.S.C. 78m(h) and 78w(a).  Responses to this collection are mandatory, pursuant to Section 13(h) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13h-1 thereunder.  The Commission will treat as confidential the information collected pursuant to this Form in a man -
ner consistent with Section 13(h)(7) of the Exchange Act, which sets forth a few limited excep -
tions.  The applicable Privacy Act system of records is SEC-1 and the routine use of the records are set forth at 40 FR 39255 (August 27, 1975) and 41 FR 5318 (February 5, 1976).
The Form is filed annually by every large trader within 45 days after the end of each full cal -
endar year.  Amendments to the Form must be filed promptly following the end of a calendar 
quarter in the event that any of the information contained in a Form 13H filing becomes inaccu -
rate for any reason.
The Commission will use the information collected pursuant to this Form 13H to identify sig -
nificant market participants, i.e., large traders.  Form 13H will allow the Commission to collect 
background information about large traders, which will contribute to the agency’s ability to conduct investigations and enforcement matters.  The Commission estimates that the average burden to respond to the Form 13H will be 18 hours.  Any member of the public may direct to the Commission any comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and any sug -
gestions for reducing this burden.
